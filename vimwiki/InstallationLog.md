WARN: postinst
Some software with pre-loaded PAM libraries might experience
warnings or failures related to missing symbols and/or versions
after any update. While unfortunate this is a limit of the
implementation of PAM and the software, and it requires you to
restart the software manually after the update.

You can get a list of such software running a command like
  lsof / | egrep -i 'del.*libpam\.so'

Alternatively, simply reboot your system.

dhcpcd has zeroconf support active by default.
This means it will always obtain an IP address even if no
DHCP server can be contacted, which will break any existing
failover support you may have configured in your net configuration.
This behaviour can be controlled with the noipv4ll configuration
file option or the -L command line switch.
See the dhcpcd and dhcpcd.conf man pages for more details.

Dhcpcd has duid enabled by default, and this may cause issues
with some dhcp servers. For more information, see

If you activate the lookup-hostname hook to look up your hostname
using the dns, you need to install net-dns/bind-tools.

Note regarding Trusted Recursive Resolver aka DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH):
Due to privacy concerns (encrypting DNS might be a good thing, sending all
DNS traffic to Cloudflare by default is not a good idea and applications
should respect OS configured settings), "network.trr.mode" was set to 5
("Off by choice") by default.
You can enable DNS-over-HTTPS in Firefox-bin's preferences.

Upstream operates a service named Normandy which allows Mozilla to
push changes for default settings or even install new add-ons remotely.
While this can be useful to address problems like 'Armagadd-on 2.0' or
revert previous decisions to disable TLS 1.0/1.1, privacy and security
concerns prevail, which is why we have switched off the use of this
service by default.
